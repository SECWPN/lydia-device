# Governance

## Project ownership

**lydia-device** is currently maintained under a **single-maintainer model**.

Primary maintainer:

- [Alexander West Templeton](mailto:support@secwpn.com) [[@azide0x37](https://github.com/azide0x37)]

---

## Decision making

- Technical decisions are made by the maintainer
- Safety considerations override feature requests
- Backwards compatibility is preferred where reasonable

---

## Contributions

- Contributions are welcome via pull request
- Acceptance is at the discretion of the maintainer
- No guarantee of roadmap alignment

---

## Future governance

If the project gains additional maintainers or downstream users,
governance may evolve to a multi-maintainer or steering-committee model.
